#if you have 2 lists of pair ie IP,MAC and MAC,IP and want to know the list with common MAC or IP
# ie want to print IP,MAC,IP or MAC,IP,MAC with corresponding MAC & IP, then this is useful
# If the client has dhcp and you scan once and get list of IP,MAC and in Rescan to know the new IP of the corresponding MAC it can be used.
